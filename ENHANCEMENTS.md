# Funding Strategy Dashboard Enhancements

This document outlines the enhancements made to the Funding Strategy Dashboard to improve its functionality, reliability, and user experience.

## Overview of Enhancements

The following enhancements have been implemented:

1. **Price History Data Storage**
   - Created a dedicated `crypto_price_history` table in Supabase
   - Implemented a script to populate the table with historical price data
   - Updated the dashboard to use the stored price data instead of fetching it on demand

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Added comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for data retrieval
   - Added user-friendly error messages and notifications

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented batch processing for data retrieval
   - Added caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimized database queries with proper indexing

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Added loading indicators for data retrieval operations
   - Implemented a more intuitive UI with tabs for different analyses
   - Added options for customizing data retrieval and display

## New Components

### 1. Price History Data Collection

The `populate_price_history.py` script fetches historical price data from exchanges and stores it in the Supabase database. Features include:

- Support for multiple exchanges (Binance, Hyperliquid)
- Configurable lookback period
- Parallel processing for faster data collection
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Batch processing to avoid API rate limits

### 2. Database Schema

The `create_price_history_table.sql` script creates the necessary database schema for storing price history data. Features include:

- Optimized column types for cryptocurrency price data
- Indexes for efficient querying
- Row-level security policies for data access control
- A view for easier data access

### 3. Dashboard Update Script

The `update_dashboard_price_history.py` script updates the dashboard to use the stored price history data. Features include:

- Automatic detection of the price history table
- Seamless integration with the existing dashboard
- Fallback to original data retrieval methods if needed

### 4. Dashboard Runner

The `run_dashboard.sh` script provides a convenient way to run the dashboard with all enhancements. Features include:

- Environment variable validation
- Optional data collection before running the dashboard
- Automatic setup of the price history table

## How to Use the Enhancements

1. **Setup the Database**
   - Run the SQL script to create the price history table:
     ```
     psql -h your_supabase_host -d postgres -U postgres -f src/scripts/create_price_history_table.sql
     ```
   - Alternatively, use the Supabase SQL editor to run the script

2. **Collect Price History Data**
   - Run the price history collection script:
     ```
     python src/scripts/populate_price_history.py --days 30 --exchange both
     ```
   - Adjust the parameters as needed for your use case

3. **Update the Dashboard**
   - Run the dashboard update script:
     ```
     python src/scripts/update_dashboard_price_history.py
     ```
   - This will modify the dashboard to use the stored price history data

4. **Run the Dashboard**
   - Use the provided shell script:
     ```
     ./run_dashboard.sh
     ```
   - Add the `--collect` flag to collect price data before running:
     ```
     ./run_dashboard.sh --collect
     ```
   - Add the `--funding` flag to collect funding data before running:
     ```
     ./run_dashboard.sh --funding
     ```

## Benefits of the Enhancements
